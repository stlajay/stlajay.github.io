I'm getting familiar with the term **open source** during 3rd year of engineering, and it is really significant and means a great deal to any computer science enthusiast.

The **[FOSS][foss]** (`Free and Open Source Software`) 


In the **All In Open Source**, I experience something new within the four month of timeline, likely to be : 

- **open stack development**,
- following open source **guide** rules,
- community interaction and building new ones, with contributing to current software or hardware
- contributions to the **technical documentation**, 
- learn more about the research and analysis in the community project,
- and working in a team on specific projects (like **hackathons** or challenges), and much more.

I'd invited to participate in [All-In hackathon][allinhack] community event. I work with others as a team, developing idea in just 24 hours and contributing to [Map API][maproject] project. Moreover, we also played important role on other challenges.

This all-encompassing learning experience is provided by [GitHub][github]'s [All-In Open Source][allinopensource].


`Fun Fact` : I recieved my graduation certificate from **University** and [All-In][allingraduate] in the same month, ***April 2023***.
