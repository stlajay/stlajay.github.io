### POST 1st: 2023-03-03

Youâ€™ll find this POST that **Microsoft Employees** from the TEAM of *Threat Intelligence* hosted 7 hours KC7 Hackathon.  I take part in.

`FIRST ROUND`:
I learned new language called [Kusto Query Language][kql] in the first hour via getting out data to find threats in the Database.

`SCOREBOARD GENERAL`

</div>

**Fun Fact** : ***Host everything kept as a secret until the Hackathon starts and before as well.***


`SECOND ROUND`

The presentation round takes-off and present it as a team presentation (Each one of us don't know about other attendees, just random selection). But actually, I did pretty well done this time :)

And this :-

`WINNNER` : 3rd (Got 500 $ as a Credit)
